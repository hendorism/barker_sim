# barker_sim
This is intended to be a simulator of the machine I used to run in the sawmill.

I took a screenshot from google satellite imagery and a photo of the controls,
then overlaid partially opaque div elements over the different components
and partially opaque html button elements over the different control buttons
in the image of the control console inside the operator booth.

Look for increased functionality as I continue to learn javascript.
