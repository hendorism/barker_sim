aaron broke loghaul drivechain on a huge log while trying to reverse because it was stuck. this log was maybe 45"x38' with some 6-8" knots which i observed on the top side. dont know about the rest.
When I tried to reverse, the drive gave up and sagged back the way it does now that kyle has installed that current diverter thing. before it would have kicked out. then when i tried again it broke the drivechain.
988f one of the prongs on the block heater plug broke off.

0703 - Aaron ran a log into #1 cold deck kicker when Anter was trying to kick a log whose forward end was in the trough still. Anter was trying to drop the log in and had the forward end in the trough when Aaron started the barker. Anter saw this and kicked the log on the cold deck but the forward end did not want to get out of the trough. As Aaron was sending a log out, everything was momentarily inactive so Aaron ran the cold deck out and continued to send a log from the barker. As he was doing this though, Anter sent out the kickers to make the forward end of that log get out of the trough. Aaron's log ran into the #1 kicker at 80% barker feed drive speed. Went over to talk with Anter and go over what happened.
    Decksaw 1st 40 stop button still defective. Has to be pressed several times for it to be able to turn on. Happening several times per day.

called kyle about various barker issues. he came up and i mentioned the following:
pressroll1 goes down faster and comes up slower
pressroll2 does not levitate
auto center hunting continually
cradle drive kicks out multiple times per day sometimes many times per day, adding many inputs to operator's work load and causing me pain in my fingers.

kyle fixed pressroll2 by changing out the valve which was the incorrect valve.
he fixed the auto center
he looked at pressroll1 and updated me what they think the issue is.
told me to let him know when cradle drive kicks out so he can get the code. said its probably a voltage spike when the conveyor is pushed or pulled.

 some issues. while kyle was watching
i pointed out to him the deviated
 track on #3 chain trough side.

leaving cold deck empty. hopefully
they can get to it tonight, but
kyle did say it's a one guy crew.


4.6.2020 monday - hog down till 07:03.

#3 cold deck chain track is bent toward mill the last
4 feet toward the trough. chain goes half off track 
when running deck out. east side of track is centered
mid chain at its trough-end.

told kyle.

kyle came and noticed damage on 
the other end of #3 chain. spent 
most of day cleaning cold deck
with curly fry so millwrights could
 weld. they got the end of the chain 
run patched up.

2nd 40' having issues toward end.

4.3.2020 infeed deck drive chain broken twice in 
the last month and maybe ten times during the five 
weeks ronin was running.
    two brand new chains full of shiny new cotter pins
sitting in the metal bin by sawmill office.

4.2.2020 asked kyle if ring drive belt tension could 
be inscreased. Suggested Ronin might have worn the 
belt resulting in decreased tension. When the ring 
binds up on a rough log an inexperienced operator
may be slow to prevent the belt rubbing on it's pulley
and screeching and smoking.

3.23.2020 #1 pressroll complete failure 
but crept up to 100% when electrician dustin 
came. down for >1 hr. replaced pressroll valve.

ronin dropped a log out the back between the building
and the infeed deck.
